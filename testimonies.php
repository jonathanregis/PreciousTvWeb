I received a long awaited financial breakthrough a day after I attended the breakthrough service. It was a miracle beyond the amount I prayed for. I have paid my debts and have enough for myself and family. God is good. God bless you Bishop Charles. ”

Dear Bishop Charles, thank you for praying for me. I was admitted to the hospital because of a sudden sickness that came upon me. The doctors did their best but it was beyond them. Someone introduced the breakthrough service to me. I sent my prayer request and within two days I was discharged, totally healed. ”
